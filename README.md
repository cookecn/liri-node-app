# About
The liri-node-app uses node to take user input and return information from one of three node-api calls. The three apis are spotify, omdb, and bandsintown. If the user says "concert-this", the switch statement will find the function listed under that input and prompt the node application to run that funciton. If "spotify-this-song" is called, spotify will return information on whatever song name you input. If "movie-this", omdb will return movie information for whatever movie you call.
