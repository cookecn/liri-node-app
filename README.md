#

# Step-by-Step!

* To begin, open your console inside Visual Studio Code with (CTRL + ALT + `).
* After the console appears, you will be able to start your search by starting with "node", as seen below.

#

*After you type node, type in "liri.js", so that the node console knows to use the liri.js file.

#

*Now, you will have 4 options to choose from, with each option granting you different results. The first: "concert-this" will search the bandsintown api and give you information on the next concert that the band is playing.

#

*The second option is "spotify-this-song", which will search the spotify API for a song and return information about said song. If no userinput is detected after "spotify-this-song" the command will show you information on "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

![spotify-this-song + (song_name)](https://github.com/cookecn/liri-node-app/tree/master/images/spotify-this-song.png =150x)

#

*The third option is to utilize "movie-this" to find relevant information on your searched movie! If no movie is searched for, the console will get mad and tell you to watch Mr. Nobody! Like this...

#

![Movie-This + (movie_name)](https://github.com/cookecn/liri-node-app/tree/master/images/movie-this.png =150x)

#

*Last but not least, "do-this", which tells the console to pull the information from a seperate file and use that information to search the spotify api. Like so...

# About
The liri-node-app uses node to take user input and return information from one of three node-api calls. The three apis are spotify, omdb, and bandsintown. If the user says "concert-this", the switch statement will find the function listed under that input and prompt the node application to run that funciton. If "spotify-this-song" is called, spotify will return information on whatever song name you input. If "movie-this", omdb will return movie information for whatever movie you call.
